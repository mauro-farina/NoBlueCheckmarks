# <img src="./assets/NoBlueCheckmarks.png" alt="Blue Checkmark" width="45" height="auto" style="vertical-align:bottom" /> NoBlueCheckmarks

Simple browser extension that removes Blue Checkmarks <img src="./assets/blue-checkmark.png" alt="Blue Checkmark" width="25" height="auto" style="vertical-align:bottom" /> from your Twitter feed. Download for free on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/nobluecheckmarks/).

Blue Checkmarks no longer dictate the value or credibility of accounts: when in November 2022 Elon Musk introduced paid-verification for Twitter Blue subscribers, the blue badge lost its original meaning of 'verified user'. Since then, many people have been using the Blue Checkmark to impersonate, scam and troll users on the platform.
Gold Checkmarks <img src="./assets/gold-checkmark.png" alt="Gold Checkmark" width="25" height="auto" style="vertical-align:bottom" /> (official businesses) and Gray Checkmarks <img src="./assets/gray-checkmark.png" alt="Gray Checkmark" width="25" height="auto" style="vertical-align:bottom" /> (governments and organizations) will not be removed by the extension, as they provide meaningful information to users.

## Future plans

- Bring the extension to Chrome
- Add a tooltip to toggle the extension
- Add possibility to remove Gold and Gray checkmarks

## Notable impersonations attempts [&#128279;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Blue_verification_controversy#Impersonation_attempts)

#### Eli Lilly and Company

On November 10, a Twitter account impersonating the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company—one of the three largest manufacturers of insulin—posted a tweet stating that insulin would be made free. **The tweet wiped US$15 billion from the company's market capitalization**. According to The Washington Post, employees at Eli Lilly rushed to contain the damage from the tweet as Twitter failed to respond to the company for several hours. The incident resulted in Eli Lilly pulling advertisements from Twitter.

#### Pentagon

On May 22, an account aligned with the conspiracy theory QAnon posted an image generated by artificial intelligence that seemingly depicted an explosion near the Pentagon. The Twitter account for the Russian propaganda television network RT then claimed that there was an explosion near the Pentagon. A verified account posing as Bloomberg News then posted the claim accompanied by several other verified accounts. The S&P 500 fell sharply as a result of the news before rebounding.

## Fake News Propaganda

For the first seven days following Hamas’ deadly terrorist attack on Israeli civilians, NewsGuard, a company that maintains a system rating the credibility of news and information websites, analyzed **the 250 most-engaged posts on X/Twitter that promoted 10 “prominent false or unsubstantiated narratives”** relating to the conflict. According to the NewsGuard analysis, 186 of the 250 posts **(74%) were posted by accounts verified by X**.
